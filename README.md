# Password Wallet
This application is used to securely store user passwords. During adding password user chooses password encryption method (using salt and pepper or using HMAC). User can edit or delete each own added password. The login module contains methods of protection against attempts to gain unauthorized access to the account. The user account is time blocked if correct login and incorrect password is entered 3 times in a row. What's more, if someone fails to log in 5 times in a row, his session ID is totally blocked.
